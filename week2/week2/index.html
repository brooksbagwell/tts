			<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
		</header>
				<p>I am originally from a small town in South Carolina. I attended the University of South Carolina for undergrad, where I majored in Graphic Design. As a big fan of the outdoors, I enjoy numerous outdoor activities. Some of those activities include mountain biking, snowboarding, longboarding, hiking, and hitting up the dog parks with my 2 year old pup. Other interests I enjoy are playing the guitar, attending live concerts, and checking out the latest movies.</p>
